                           Law enforcement<br>
                           Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if
                           required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court
                           or a government agency).<br>

                           Other legal requirements<br>
                           The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is

                           Security of Your Personal Data<br>
                           The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of
                           transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We
                           strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot
                           guarantee its absolute security.<br>

                           Children's Privacy
                           Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
                           personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or

                           Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13
                           without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our
                           servers.<br>

                           If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your
                           country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We
                           collect and use that information.<br>
